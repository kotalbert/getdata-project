This file describes main attributes of the data in 'tidy_set.txt' file.
The smartphone signal data was combined in order to create 'tidy' data, with clearly labeled rows and columns.

The original data was collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
These signals were used to estimate variables ofThese time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

In the original data set, for each measured feature, set of statistics were estimated. For the purpose of the project, only the mean and standard deviation were extracted. Variables representing statistics value were identified by the statistic name in the variable name, i.e. "mean" and "std".

In addition, feature names provided in the original data set were transformed to remove any non alphanumerical character and convert all characters to lower case - as suggested in the course lectures.
